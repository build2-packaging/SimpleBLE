# Development Notes

The header file `simpleble/export.h` in the `libsimpleble` package is actually not symlinked but was manually created. In the upstream project this file is created in a platform-dependent way by the build system.

If the upstream version is updated, this file has to be revised and adjusted, if needed by the new version.
